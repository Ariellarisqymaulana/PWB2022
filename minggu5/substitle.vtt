A Man Without Love
Engelbert Humperdinck

I can remember when we walked together
Sharin' a love I thought would last forever
Moonlight to show the way, so we can follow
Waitin' inside her eyes was my tomorrow

Then something changed her mind
Her kisses told me
I had no lovin' arms to hold me

Every day, I wake up, then I start to break up
Lonely is a man without love
Every day, I start out, then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love

Every day, I wake up, then I start to break up
Knowin' that it's cloudy above
Every day, I start out, then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love

I cannot face this world that's fallen down on me
So, if you see my girl, please send her home to me
Tell her about my heart that's slowly dyin'
Say I can't stop myself from cryin'

Every day, I wake up, then I start to break up
Lonely is a man without love
Every day, I start out, then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love

Every day, I wake up, then I start to break up
Knowin' that it's cloudy above
Every day, I start out, then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love

Every day, I wake up, then I start to break up
Lonely is a man without love
Every day, I start out, then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love
